## Introduction

The schema library is aimed to provide a set of interfaces to make it easier to interact with JSON. For example, making more exact requirements for JSON than pattern matching can in the language.

We not only support simple verification, but also hope to provide accurate inspection information to users when the inspection fails.

> For experimental development progress, please refer to other branches in the repository.
